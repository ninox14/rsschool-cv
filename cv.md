## About me

I am 23yo currently a second-year master's student in CS at Sumy State University. I came to RollingScopesSchool cause it is a great opportunity to learn something new and as for me has a great environment to study things I'm interested in.
I like that subtle feeling of joy when you overcome a problem that boggled you for some time.

I have interests in:

 * Problem-solving
 * Learning how things work and why they work in that particular way
 * And other things that put wrinkles on my brain :)

 One of my core strengths is that I'm a skilled learner cause I strive to find out and deeply understand how things work.

## My skills

 * HTML/CSS
 * JS Basics
 * Python
 * Git basics
 * UNIX experience

## Code example

```javascript
    function findOutlier(integers) {
        let odd = [];
        let even = [];
        for (let i = 0; i < integers.length; i++) {
            if (integers[i] % 2 == 0) even.push(integers[i]);
            else odd.push(integers[i]);
        }
        if (odd.length > even.length) return even[0];
        else return odd[0];
    }
```
